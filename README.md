# Homework #9 Surfs Up

## Overview of Analysis

### W. Avy, our business partner, wants to compare the temperature data for June and December to ensure that the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable throughout the year.  To do that we will create dataframes containing the temperature readings for each month and perform statistical analysis for each. 

## Results

* ### [June Results](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW9_Surfs_Up/blob/main/Resources/images/june.png)
### The mean temperature in June is nearly 75 degrees with a standard deviation of about 3.25 degrees.  That type of weather provides plenty of good surfing and ice cream eating opportunites!

* ### [December Results](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW9_Surfs_Up/blob/main/Resources/images/dec.png)
### December has a mean temperature of right about 71 degrees with a standard deviations of 3.75 degress.  While this may lead to some days that are less attractive for surfing and ice cream consumption there are still ample opportunities for each.  While the locals may not find 65 degrees to be beach weather, there are likely numerous tourists escaping much colder weather back home and will be basking in such weather.  They may not be great surfers but I bet they love ice cream!

## Summary

* ### Completed Results
### The analysis confirms that the surf and ice cream shop business proposal is a sound one and will be sure to be a profitable venture for all involved parties.  The sooner the plans can be put into motion the better for all.  Especially the hungry surfers among the population!

* ### Additional Analysis
  - ### If there are more questions perhaps an analysis could be done to chart the temperatures throughout the entire year.  Are all the months as sustainable as June and December?
  - ### Another possibility would be to chart the tempuratures over the years of data that is available.  Is climate change moving in one direction or another that could affect the sustainability of this venture?
